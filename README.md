# SPP_BIS_PVP_BOTS

To make the existing SPP (Single Player Project) bots better and more powerful in the way they are equipped. 
This will ensure that the lvl 80 bots are BIS (best in class) PVP equipped to have a more "real" and "hard" feeling. 

First run "Deletion File SQL_delete all existing lvl 80 SPP bot gear.sql"
Next you can import files from "SQL" folder.

Note:
If you want to deinstall the bot gear, you will also find the uninstall SQL.
